Abstract Painting.
Everyday, Gon practices his painting skill on a rectangular canvas, divided into 𝑅⋅𝐶 unit squares, with 𝑅 rows and 𝐶 columns. Gon wants to paint all the edges of all unit squares.

Contrary to popular belief, creating a good modern painting is not an easy task. A good modern painting should use a limited number of colors, simple yet elegant. Thus, when creating his painting, Gon strictly adheres to the following rules:

Only 3 colors are used: Red, Green and Blue.

All edges of all unit squares must be painted. Each edge must be painted with exactly one color.

For each unit square, exactly 2 colors must be used to paint its 4 edges. Furthermore, each color must be used to paint exactly 2 edges.

In the following figure:

The painting on the left is a good painting.

The painting on the right is not a good painting, because the top-left unit square has 3 blue edges.

Now Gon is wondering, how many different good paintings are there? Two paintings, both with 𝑅 rows and 𝐶 columns, are considered different, if there exists one edge painted with different colors in the two paintings. Please help Gon!

Input
The first line contains exactly one integer 𝑇 — the number of test cases (1≤𝑇≤5).

𝑇 lines follow, each line contains exactly two integers 𝑅 and 𝐶 (1≤𝑅≤14,1≤𝐶≤2000).

Output
Output exactly 𝑇 lines, each line contains a single integer — the number of different good paintings, modulo 109+7.
